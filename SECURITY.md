# Security Policy

This is the Security Policy for Voyager, in which we will go over full detail of security related things, like reporting vulnerabilities, version support plans and more. Let's start!

## Version Support Plans

The current plan (drafted by me, @dynamixbot) are to support the versions for as long as we can (without getting in financial trouble). When a new version is released, the old version will be supported until all users have transitioned.
After that, the version will be deprecated and will not work at all. Internal minor updates to the scraper and database will be added in minor patch updates. Major changes or switches will be added only to the new versions.
Experimental versions will be immediately deprecated after a release of a stable version. Any damage or failure to a service relying on experimental versions are not the responsibility of GetVoyager, Snarple or any affiliates.

## Vulnerability discovery and fixing

People who will report vulnerabilities will be named in new patch updates and will be thanked for reporting/fixing the bug.
It is also appreciated to provide a temporary fix when you post a bug to temporarily patch and push the fix. After that, our developers will fix the bug with a permanent fix and be pushed.
There are three levels of bugs - level 1 bugs, which are fixed in minor patch updates. level 2 bugs, which are considered major fixes, and level 3 bugs, which need immediate attention and are updated in whole new versions.

## Hacking or Exploiting

People found exploiting bugs will be banned from using Snarple-developed freeware like Voyager, Snazzle and others.
Exploiters can appeal their ban after 1 year of being banned to ensure punishment is received for exploiting.
This rule is exempt for people who report the bug before exploiting to test if bug is patched.
